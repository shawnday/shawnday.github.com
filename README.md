# Module Agenda

## Week 1
*Thursday 24 September*

Getting Started with an Introduction to Social Computing
We will introduce ourselves and some general concepts, theories and a roadmap for the course. This week we will gain a shared understanding of social computing and an exploration of the facets we will use to measure and assess impact.

If you are serious about Information Systems (and you indicate a certain degree of interest if not determination by joining this programme) it is important to make the right associations. One suggested membership that you will find valuable is with the Association of Information Systems (AIS). You can join for as low as $6 and I would suggest that this is a huge bargain. Access to their library of research alone is well worth it.
